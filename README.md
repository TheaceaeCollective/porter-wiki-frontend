### This is the frontend code for the Camellia Wiki (rewritten)

### [Alpha](https://alpha.camellia.wiki) | Live

> [!NOTE]
> Alpha will move to Beta (beta.camellia.wiki) once core features are implemented. We will go live to camellia.wiki once beta testing passes quality assurance.
>
> Regarding the current (soon legacy), it will remain available at legacy.camellia.wiki once the change has begun, subject to takedown at any given point.

## Articles
